Typing Speed Test
Overview
The Typing Speed Test is a simple Python program built using Pygame that allows users to test and improve their typing speed. The program displays a random sentence, records user input, and calculates Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy.
Features
âœ… Displays a random sentence for the user to type
âœ… Measures typing speed in Words Per Minute (WPM)
âœ… Calculates accuracy percentage
âœ… Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI)
âœ… Real-time feedback while typing
How to Run
Clone this repository or download the files.
Ensure pygame is installed using the command:
pip install pygame
Add your own sentences to sentences.txt (one per line).
Run the Python script:
python main.py
How It Works
A random sentence appears on the screen.
The user types the sentence into the input field.
The program starts timing when the user presses the first key.
Pressing Enter submits the typed text and displays:
Typing Speed (WPM)
Accuracy (%)
The results are shown, and the user can restart to try again.
Future Enhancements
ðŸš€ Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)
ðŸš€ Implement a restart button
ðŸš€ Store high scores
ðŸš€ Add background music or typing sounds
